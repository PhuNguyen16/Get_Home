You definitely don’t have a drinking problem
You live like this?
You’re fighting for this room?
Somehow, you smell worse than your apartment
You’d honestly be better off homeless
Think! Randy! Think!!
Maybe I’ll take your BLOOD as payment!
You know what, I actually enjoy this.
You’re gonna need to hit me harder than that
I LOVE the sounds of BONES CRACKING
I must break you.
It’s a long way down Randy!
Elevator going up!
